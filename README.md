## Machine-learning-python
 - Gender predicter
  - predict gender by sizes of the human based on given training data
  - This will be simple decision tree example
  - Decision tree is simplest regression algorithm (To under stand how regression Works)
  - This will use user given dataset to train and pridict (To understand dataset and importance of large dataset)
 - Iris
  - This also uses decision tree algo 
  - This uses pre defined dataset from scikit-learn (To understand use exiesting dataset from online)
